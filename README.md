# Beautiful Vues

Use NASA's astronomy picture of the day API to generate a beautiful picture with its description, along with an optional inspirational quote from a STEM figure.  Save your favorites and add your own thoughts!

*Originaly built with the MEVN stack in <36 hours by Blade Boles, who had never seen Vue or MongoDB until the previous Monday.*

Update (07/19/20): Did some tutorials on vuex and vue router over the last 2 days.  Implemented what I learned with some basic routing and a store (with vuex).  Added the ability to remove favorites.  App, although still very simple, is now organized and structured more like a production app on the front end.

To Do: 

1. Add ability to click on image in favorites to view hd
2. Add ability to add/edit a note to a favorite after creating it
3. Add ability to generate meme with meme api
4. Better styling

## User Stories:

1. I can enter a date (or use the current date) and get the NASA apod for that date, along with its explanation.  

2. I have the option to include a random inspirational quote from a STEM figure

3. Once my quote and image are generated, I have the option to add them to a list of favorites.

4. (Stretch) I can add notes to my favorites or delete them

5. (Stretch) I can CRUD my own inspirational quotes

6. (Stretch) I can share my favorites

7. (Stretch, found API!) I can generate an inspirational meme with
